# iNet-Monitor
A simple WPF monitor that sits in the tray area and shows the status of your internet connection.

## About
This is a internet monitor that i myself needed, and therefore decided to create and share with the world ;)

## But what does it DO?
It is a simple application that starts with windows and runs in the tray area with a little globe icon.
The globe icon changes color:
- Green: Your internet is working.
- Yellow: Getting a bit slow.
- Red: you have lost the internet!

Also the main application shows you some useful information:
- Local/Internet - IP address.
- Computername
- Hostname

It also shows you a nice graph of how your internet has been doing, with some statistics.
It also shows you popup notifications.

And some icing for the cake, a settings menu:
- Turn on/off start with windows.
- Disable popup notification.
- Interval to test internet.
- how high latency before it registers as 'slow'

## How expenssive is this wonderful application?
FREE!! :D
Yes absolutely free to use for private or business forever!
but if you feel like showing some love, you are more than welcome to show the DONATE button some love ;)
I would truly appreciate it! <3

## Can i not just download and install it?
I am working really hard on getting a website up and running to host my software and a service to check and push updates, to
make everyones lives much easier! So that will come very soon i promise :)
